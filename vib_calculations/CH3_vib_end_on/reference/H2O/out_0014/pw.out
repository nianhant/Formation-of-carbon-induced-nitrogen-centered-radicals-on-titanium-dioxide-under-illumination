     Current dimensions of program PWSCF are:
     Max number of different atomic species (ntypx) = 10
     Max number of k-points (npk) =  40000
     Max angular momentum in pseudopotentials (lmaxx) =  3
     Presently no symmetry can be used with electric field

     the Fermi energy is    -4.4710 ev

!    total energy              =     -34.79493622 Ry
     estimated scf accuracy    <       0.00000003 Ry
     smearing contrib. (-TS)   =      -0.00000000 Ry
     internal energy E=F+TS    =     -34.79493622 Ry

     The total energy is F=E-TS. E is the sum of the following terms:
     one-electron contribution =     -64.14127525 Ry
     hartree contribution      =      33.62570861 Ry
     xc contribution           =      -8.81522004 Ry
     ewald contribution        =       4.53500504 Ry
     electric field correction =       0.00084541 Ry

     convergence has been achieved in  24 iterations

     Forces acting on atoms (cartesian axes, Ry/au):

     atom    1 type  1   force =    -0.00002276    0.00032641    0.00050496

     atom    3 type  2   force =     0.00001664   -0.00077648   -0.00037960

     Total force =     0.001152     Total SCF correction =     0.000242
     SCF correction compared to forces is large: reduce conv_thr to get better values

     Current dimensions of program PWSCF are:
     Max number of different atomic species (ntypx) = 10
     Max number of k-points (npk) =  40000
     Max angular momentum in pseudopotentials (lmaxx) =  3
     Presently no symmetry can be used with electric field

     the Fermi energy is    -4.4584 ev

!    total energy              =     -34.79493624 Ry
     estimated scf accuracy    <          2.7E-09 Ry

     internal energy E=F+TS    =     -34.79493624 Ry

     The total energy is F=E-TS. E is the sum of the following terms:

     ewald contribution        =       4.53500535 Ry
     electric field correction =       0.00084517 Ry

     convergence has been achieved in  28 iterations

     Total force =     0.001306     Total SCF correction =     0.000172
     SCF correction compared to forces is large: reduce conv_thr to get better values

     Current dimensions of program PWSCF are:
     Max number of different atomic species (ntypx) = 10
     Max number of k-points (npk) =  40000
     Max angular momentum in pseudopotentials (lmaxx) =  3
     Presently no symmetry can be used with electric field

     the Fermi energy is    -4.4709 ev

!    total energy              =     -34.79493702 Ry
     estimated scf accuracy    <       0.00000003 Ry
     smearing contrib. (-TS)   =      -0.00000000 Ry
     internal energy E=F+TS    =     -34.79493702 Ry

     The total energy is F=E-TS. E is the sum of the following terms:
     one-electron contribution =     -64.14094277 Ry
     hartree contribution      =      33.62572313 Ry
     xc contribution           =      -8.81522540 Ry
     ewald contribution        =       4.53466238 Ry
     electric field correction =       0.00084564 Ry

     convergence has been achieved in  24 iterations

     Forces acting on atoms (cartesian axes, Ry/au):

     atom    1 type  1   force =    -0.00008503    0.00041635    0.00040230

     atom    3 type  2   force =     0.00004501   -0.00079046   -0.00036116

     Total force =     0.001115     Total SCF correction =     0.000564
     SCF correction compared to forces is large: reduce conv_thr to get better values

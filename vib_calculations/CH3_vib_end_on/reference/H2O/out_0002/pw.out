     Current dimensions of program PWSCF are:
     Max number of different atomic species (ntypx) = 10
     Max number of k-points (npk) =  40000
     Max angular momentum in pseudopotentials (lmaxx) =  3
     Presently no symmetry can be used with electric field

     the Fermi energy is    -4.4676 ev

!    total energy              =     -34.79493698 Ry
     estimated scf accuracy    <       0.00000006 Ry

     internal energy E=F+TS    =     -34.79493698 Ry

     The total energy is F=E-TS. E is the sum of the following terms:
     one-electron contribution =     -64.14148157 Ry
     hartree contribution      =      33.62635318 Ry
     xc contribution           =      -8.81534372 Ry
     ewald contribution        =       4.53468938 Ry
     electric field correction =       0.00084575 Ry

     convergence has been achieved in  25 iterations

     Total force =     0.001109     Total SCF correction =     0.000648
     SCF correction compared to forces is large: reduce conv_thr to get better values

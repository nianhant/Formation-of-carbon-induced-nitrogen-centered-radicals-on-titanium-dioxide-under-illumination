     Current dimensions of program PWSCF are:
     Max number of different atomic species (ntypx) = 10
     Max number of k-points (npk) =  40000
     Max angular momentum in pseudopotentials (lmaxx) =  3
     Presently no symmetry can be used with electric field

     Message from routine cell_base_init:
     DEPRECATED: use true lattice parameter, not A to a.u. conversion factor

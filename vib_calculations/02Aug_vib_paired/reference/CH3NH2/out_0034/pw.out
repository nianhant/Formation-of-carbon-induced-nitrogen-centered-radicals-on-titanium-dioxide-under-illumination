     Current dimensions of program PWSCF are:
     Max number of different atomic species (ntypx) = 10
     Max number of k-points (npk) =  40000
     Max angular momentum in pseudopotentials (lmaxx) =  3
     Presently no symmetry can be used with electric field

!    total energy              =     -37.69692703 Ry
     estimated scf accuracy    <          7.9E-09 Ry
     smearing contrib. (-TS)   =      -0.00000000 Ry
     internal energy E=F+TS    =     -37.69692703 Ry

     The total energy is F=E-TS. E is the sum of the following terms:
     one-electron contribution =    -128.20583681 Ry
